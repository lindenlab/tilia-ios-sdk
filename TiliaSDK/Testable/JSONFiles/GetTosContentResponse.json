If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not register for an Account or otherwise access or use any portion of the Tilia Service. THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT AUTHORIZES EITHER PARTY TO ELECT MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION OF CERTAIN DISPUTES. THE TERMS OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION ARE SET FORTH IN SECTION 12 BELOW, ENTITLED \"DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION.\" PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY.\n\nThe Tilia Service is offered through Tilia’s integrations with websites (each, a \"Platform\") that are offered by third parties (each, a \"Publisher\"). Access to all or a portion of the Tilia Service through these Platforms and Publishers may be available or discontinued at the sole discretion of Tilia. You agree that your use of the Platform through which you access the Tilia Service is governed by the relevant Publisher's end user license agreement and/or terms of use, including, without limitation, password and account security policies (collectively, the \"Platform TOS\"). We do not assume any responsibility for the content, policies or practices of any Platform, Publisher or other third party, including any Platform TOS, and you hereby agree that we are not liable for any loss arising from your use of any Platform, any act or omission of any Publisher or other third party, or the terms of any Platform TOS. These Terms incorporate by reference all policies, guidelines, notices, and other content regarding the Tilia Service (collectively, the \"Website\"). In the event of any material conflict or inconsistency between these Terms and any such policies, guidelines, notices, these Terms prevail with respect to the provision of the Tilia Service.\n\nThese Terms contain the above provisions and the following 13 sections. The headings and subheadings are for reference only and do not limit the scope of each section.\n\n1.  The Tilia Service\n2.  Our Relationship with You\n3.  Payment Processing\n4.  Stored Value Balances\n5.  Digital Tokens\n6.  Intellectual Property and Licenses\n7.  Communications\n8.  Term and Termination\n9.  Fees\n10. Customer Complaints – Money Transmission Activity\n11. Releases, Disclaimers, Liability Limits and Identification\n12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration\n13. General Provisions\n\n\n\n1.  The Tilia Service\n\nThe Tilia Service is designed to allow you to:\n\na)  make payments for digital goods and services;\nb)  hold and load funds in a Stored Value Balance (as defined below) and make payments for digital goods and services (“Digital Goods”) to third parties and other users of the Platform;\nc)  use Tilia issued tokens on a Publisher’s Platform to use or access features or content within a Publisher’s Platform;\nd)  facilitate the use of in-Platform content, and access other related services within a Platform.\n\nWhile the Tilia Service is integrated into certain selected Platforms, the Tilia Service is offered by Tilia and not by the Publisher of the relevant Platform.\n\nTilia is not responsible for the provision of the Platform itself or any experience within the Platform—just the Tilia Service. This means, for example, that Tilia is not responsible or liable for the Digital Goods offered and provided by Publishers to you.\n\nTilia does not have control of, nor liability for, any Publisher or other third party content that is accessed using the Tilia Service or any products or services that are paid for using the Tilia Service. In the event of any conflict between the relevant Platform TOS and these Terms, these Terms will govern as between you and Tilia, and with respect to the Tilia Service.\n\nAs the different features of the Tilia Service that are enabled for a particular Platform will be determined by the relevant Publisher and Tilia, the Platform TOS applicable to that Platform may use slightly different terminology to refer to the Tilia Service features available through the Platform.\n\nTilia may offer some or all of the following as part of the Tilia Service provided through any particular Platform:\n\na)  payment processing services (as described below);\nb)  Stored Value Balances (as defined below) provided to you and other Platform users;\nc)  other permissible and supported payment services as may be requested by a Publisher; and/or\nd)  digital token issuance (as described below)\n\nIn accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, Tilia has the right to change, limit access to, or eliminate any aspect(s), feature(s) or functionality of the Tilia Service in its sole discretion at any time without notice, and Tilia makes no commitment (express or implied) to offer, maintain, continue, or permit access to any aspect of the Tilia Service. Additionally, Tilia can authorize or decline a transaction effected with the Tilia Service for whatever reason (e.g., for suspected fraud or insufficient funds), restrict the number of transactions you may engage in over a period of time, or limit the amount of any transaction (either individually or in the aggregate over a period of time).\n\n\n\n2.  Our Relationship with You\n\n\n2.1.  Eligibility\n\nIn order to be eligible to access and use the Tilia Service, you must (i) be eighteen (18) years of age or older, (ii) have the legal ability to enter into and be bound by these Terms and the relevant Platform TOS, (iii) have accepted the Platform TOS applicable to the particular Platform through which you are accessing the Tilia Service and remain eligible to access and use such Platform, (iv) comply with these Terms, and (iv) establish and maintain an active and valid user account with Tilia (”Account” or “Tilia Account”).\n\nTo create a Tilia Account and/or access certain features or functionality of the Tilia Service, we require you to provide us with your name, address, date of birth, telephone number, street address or post code, and other information that will allow us to identify you (please see Section 2.4 Identity Verification below). We may also ask to see your driver's licence or other identifying documents. For further details on what we may collect, please see our Privacy Policy.\n\nYou agree to provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself and to use the Account management tools provided to keep that information accurate, current and complete. We may request additional information from you in the future. We will review and validate the information you provide to us to ensure we have a reasonable belief of your identity. This is in accordance with our obligations under applicable anti-money laundering regulations.\n\nWe reserve the right to refuse, suspend, limit or terminate your access to all or a portion of the Tilia Service at any time in our sole discretion.\n\nAs the features and functionality of the Tilia Service provided through a particular Platform are specific to that Platform, you may need to create and maintain a Tilia Account in connection with each such Platform through which you wish to access the Tilia Service. Your Tilia Account may be in addition to any account you must maintain with a Publisher or other third party to use a Platform or access a payment method in connection with the Tilia Service, and terms and conditions applicable to those accounts in no way modify, lessen, or alter your obligations to Tilia under these Terms.\n\nYou may not sell, transfer or assign your Tilia Account (including any associated Stored Value Balance, as defined in Section 4 below) or any associated contractual rights, licences or obligations, to any third party without the prior written consent of Tilia.\n\n\n2.2.  Acceptable Use\n\nWhen using the Tilia Service and/or Website, you must always do so for legal, authorized and acceptable purposes.\n\nYour use and access of the Tilia Service is your choice and you are solely responsible for compliance with applicable local laws regarding your online conduct and acceptable content.

You agree not to use your Account or other portion of the Tilia Service for any unlawful purpose.\n\nWhen using the Tilia Service and/or Website, you will not, nor permit any person using your Account and/or accessing the Website to:\n\n*   use them in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with or contravening these Terms;\n*   violate or infringe the rights of Tilia, any of its group companies, our users, or other third parties, including rights in respect of privacy, intellectual property, or other proprietary rights;\n*   provide false, inaccurate or misleading information;\n*   engage in any potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity and/or transactions, including receiving money which may be fraudulent or adding money to your Account which may be linked to criminal activities;\n*   refuse to cooperate with an investigation or provide any information we request, including with respect to verifying your identity;\n*   transmit any communication, material or other content that is illegal, obscene, defamatory, threatening, intimidating, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or which could instigate or encourage conduct that would be illegal or otherwise inappropriate, including promoting violent crimes;\n*   impersonate someone;\n*   seek to harm Tilia, our group companies, or any of our users or customers; or\n*   access, use, copy, modify, distribute, display, otherwise exploit or prepare derivative works based upon and of the Tilia Service in impermissible or unauthorized manners, or in ways that harm us, our group companies, the Tilia Service, systems, users, or others. In particular you must not, nor permit any person using your Account or accessing the Website to:\n    *   reverse engineer, alter, modify, create derivative works from, decompile, or extract code from the Tilia Service, except to the extent permitted by law;\n    *   send, store, or transmit viruses or other harmful computer code through or onto the Tilia Service;\n    *   gain or attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or those of our group companies;\n    *   create accounts for the Tilia Service through unauthorized means;\n    *   collect the information of or about our users in any impermissible or unauthorized manner; and/or\n    *   sell, resell, rent, or charge for the use of, the Tilia Service.\n\nYou are not permitted to use the Tilia Service if you are in, under the control of, or a national or resident of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria or any other country subject to United States embargo, UN sanctions, the European Union or HM Treasury's financial sanctions regimes (each a \"Sanctioned Country\"), or if you are a person on the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Commerce Department's Denied Persons List, Unverified List, Entity List, or the EU or HM Treasury's financial sanctions regime (a \"Sanctioned Person\") or you intend to supply the Tilia Service to a Sanctioned Country (or a national or resident of a Sanctioned Country) or Sanctioned Person.\n\n\n2.3.  Your Privacy\n\nProtecting your privacy and your personal data is very important to Tilia. Our practices governing the collection and use of your personal data are detailed in our Privacy Policy. Please review this policy before you provide us with your personal data in order to better understand our commitment to maintaining your privacy, as well as our use of your personal data.\n\nYour decision to use the Tilia Service is purely voluntary and optional. However, as detailed above, to use the Tilia Service, you must have a Tilia Account which we require certain of your personal data to create. If you elect not to provide the requisite personal data then you will not be able to create a Tilia Account or access or use the Tilia Service.\n\nAs the Tilia Service is integrated into Platforms offered by Publishers, you may be asked to provide certain personal data to a Publisher or other third party in connection with your use of a Platform. Such information is subject to the privacy policy of the relevant Publisher or other third party.\n\n\n2.4.  Identity Verification\n\nIf you use certain aspects of the Tilia Service (specifically, holding a Stored Value Balance), applicable law requires that Tilia verify your identity. This means that Tilia requires you to provide your name, street address, date of birth, social security number, and other information that will allow us to identify you.\n\nWe may also ask to see a copy of your driver’s license or other documents, at our sole discretion, at any time.  For more information on how we use this information and your rights in respect of such use, please see our Privacy Policy.\n\nYou may be required to provide confirmation of ownership of your email address, financial instruments, your source of funds and/or you may have to verify your information against third party databases or other sources.\n\nYou authorize Tilia, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity and the information you provide to us.\n\nIt is your responsibility to keep us updated of changes to your information, including e-mail address and mobile numbers. Failure to do so may result in us being unable to:\n\na)  contact you regarding your Account and/or Stored Value Balance;\nb)  comply with applicable laws; and/or\nc)  let you know about changes to these Terms.\n\nTilia reserves the right to close, suspend, or limit access to your Account and/or the Tilia Service in the event we are unable to obtain or verify information or your identity.\n\n\n2.5.  Security\n\nYou are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), or any other codes that you use to access your Account, your Stored Value Balance (see Section 4 below) or the Tilia Service.\n\nYou must not allow another person to:\n\na)  use security information related to your Account or Stored Value Balance (as defined below);\nb)  write down password(s) or any security information unless this is done in a way that would make it impossible for anyone else to recognise any of that information;\nc)  disclose passwords or any security information, or otherwise make them available to any other person, whether verbally or by entering them in a way that allows them to be observed by others.\n\nAny loss or compromise of your electronic device or your security details may result in unauthorized access to or use of your Account or Stored Value Balance by third parties and the loss or theft of any funds and any associated accounts, including your bank account(s), account(s) held with payment service providers and electronic money issuers and/or payment card(s).\n\nYou therefore must keep your security details safe at all times.\n\nYou are fully responsible for all activity that occurs on your Account and/or Stored Value Balance, including for any actions taken by persons to whom you may have granted access to your Account and/or Stored Value Balance. Tilia is not responsible for transactions that are effected using your Account, and/or Stored Value Balance or any other use of your Account if someone accesses your Account and/or Stored Value Balance IDs, passwords, or other codes necessary to access your Account and/or Stored Value Balance, or any losses that you may suffer therefrom.\n\nIf you suspect that your Account and/or Stored Value Balance or any of your security details have been compromised or if you become aware of any fraud or attempted fraud or any other security incident (including a cyber-security attack) affecting you and / or Tilia together a \"Security Breach\"), you must notify us as soon as possible by email at: paymentsupport@tilia.io, or by calling us at: (855) 983-4646 (international charges may apply).\n\nWe are not liable for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses or other malicious code that may affect your computer or other equipment you use to access the Tilia Service, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack related to your use of the Tilia Service. We advise the regular use of a reputable and readily available virus screening and prevention software. You should also be aware that SMS and email services are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing messages purporting to originate from us.\n\n\n\n3.  Payment Processing Service\n\nTilia offers a service through which you may, using payment methods supported by Tilia, make payments to the relevant Publisher or other users of the Publishers Platform for products or services offered within the Publisher’s Platform and/or other amounts owed to the Publisher (such service, the “Payment Processing Service”).\n\nIn offering the Payment Processing Service, Tilia’s responsibilities to you are limited to remitting payment successfully received by Tilia from you to the relevant Publisher or user in accordance with your instructions. Tilia is not responsible for any product or service purchased through your use of the Payment Processing Service, or for the amount or validity of any amount that may be charged by the relevant Publisher or user.\n\nIf the Payment Processing Service is enabled for your particular Platform, you will be directed to a Tilia-hosted dialog box after selecting the option on the Platform to make a payment (e.g., for Platform subscription fees), at which time you will have the option to complete the transaction using one of the payment methods that Tilia supports. The different payment methods supported by the Payment Processing Service, such as credit cards, debit cards, etc., will be determined by Tilia in its sole discretion, and Tilia reserves the right to limit the payment methods made available for any particular transaction.\n\nYou may need to have an existing account or other access device in order to use a particular payment method, or meet other specific conditions imposed by the company responsible for offering such payment method (each a \"Payment Services Provider\" or \"PSP\"). Additionally, the PSP might have its own terms and conditions (including a privacy policy) that also apply to you and your use of the relevant payment method, even when such payment method is accessed through the Payment Processing Service. Tilia is not responsible for any terms and conditions, privacy policy, other policies and procedures, or any act or omission of any PSP.\n\nIn order to conduct a payment through the Payment Processing Service, you will need to provide your payment or account information, and any other information, required by Tilia and the PSP you have selected. The information required and the manner in which your transaction will be processed will vary depending upon the payment method you select. You are responsible for providing accurate transaction and payment information (including any relevant PSP credentials, preferences, or log-in information) in connection with your use of the Payment Processing Service. If you fail to provide accurate transaction or payment information, your account may be suspended or terminated, and you will be responsible for any costs incurred by Tilia due to this failure. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure that your credit or debit cards or other access devices accepted by Tilia continue to be valid and sufficient for such purposes and remain responsible to Tilia for the amount of any chargeback or returned payment. Without limiting any other rights or remedies of Tilia, Tilia may exercise its termination rights as provided in Section 8 of these Terms in the event of non-payment.\n\nOnce you complete and submit the requested information to Tilia, Tilia will forward the relevant information you provide to the selected PSP, which will then authorize or decline the transaction according to its own processes and rules. If the transaction is authorized, the PSP will debit your account or designated funding source for the amount of the transaction (including any fees owed to Tilia for using the Payment Processing Service). Upon Tilia's receipt of those funds from the PSP, Tilia will remit such amount (less any amounts owed to Tilia) to the Publisher in accordance with the payment terms established between Tilia and the Publisher or to the other user of the Platform. Payments made to a Publisher through your use of the Payment Processing Service will be credited by the Publisher in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Publisher. Please contact the Publisher for further information. We are not responsible for any delay with respect to when payments made to a Publisher will be credited to you, or any failure of a Publisher to accept or properly process any funds remitted to it. Once accepted by Tilia, you may not cancel a payment made through the Payment Processing Service or obtain a refund from Tilia for any such payment. In the event that you wish to obtain a refund of any payment made, you must contact the relevant Publisher, and the availability of any refund will be subject to the relevant Platform TOS and the determination of the relevant Publisher.\n\nBy using the Payment Processing Service, you authorize Tilia to:\n\n*   Accept and remit payments made by you using the payment methods supported by Tilia for purchases or other transactions enabled for the particular Platform or for amounts owed to the relevant Publisher or user plus any applicable taxes Tilia is required to collect or fees owed to Tilia;\n*   Provide your payment and/or account information, and any other information you have provided to Tilia, to the PSP you have selected as may be required to process your requested transaction;\n*   Automatically charge, in accordance with the instructions you provide for any recurring payments, the credit or debit card or other payment method you have associated with your Tilia Account in order to pay recurring amounts to the relevant Publisher, as well as any applicable taxes Tilia is required to collect or fees owed to Tilia; and\n*   Maintain and utilize your PSP credentials, preferences, and log-in information.\n\n\n\n4.  Stored Value Balances\n\n\n4.1.  General\n\nTilia may offer a Stored Value Balance associated with your Account, which is a stored value account issued by Tilia in which you hold funds.\n\nThe Stored Value Balance services provided to you by Tilia are a hosted digital wallet issued by Tilia enabling you to store funds or Digital Tokens electronically (the \"Stored Value Balance\"); and certain payment services enabling you to do the following:\n\na)  send funds or Digital Tokens electronically (i.e., funds held in the Stored Value Balance can be used to make payments to other Platform users or to the Publisher);\nb)  receive funds or Digital Tokens electronically in accordance with Section 4.2 below (i.e., funds can be received into the Stored Value Balance from you, other Platform users, or the Publisher or as a result of the exchange of Digital Tokens issued by Tilia on a Platform); and,\nc)  redeem funds held in the Stored Value Balance in accordance with Section 4.3 below.\n\nDepending on our arrangement with the Publisher, your Stored Value Balance may hold funds denominated in fiat or Digital Tokens, defined in Section 5 below, and we will show the balance that you hold, to the extent applicable. The default fiat for the Stored Value Balance will be United States Dollars (“USD”).\n\nThe use of each Stored Value Balance is limited to the Platform in connection with which it is issued, meaning that it may not be used to make payments to any other Publisher, or through any other Platform, with which the Tilia Service is integrated.\n\nYou must not create security over your Stored Value Balance unless we say you can in writing.\n\n\n4.2.  Crediting the Stored Value Balance\n\nYou may fund your Stored Value Balance denominated in fiat using any of our supported payment methods, which are set out and available on the Publisher’s website, such as credit or debit card or bank transfer. The Stored Value Balance denominated in Digital Tokens can only be funded by the sale of a Digital Good on the applicable Platform.\n\nIn accordance with our obligations under applicable anti-money laundering regulations, you will not have access to your funds without providing information as required in Section 2.4 of these Terms.\n\nThe Stored Value Balance is not a deposit or investment account.\n\nWe will ensure that once we have received the funds associated with your fiat-denominated Stored Value Balance they are deposited in a secure account, specifically for the purpose of redeeming transactions made from your Stored Value Balance. Funds will not be insured to you by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other entity, and you will not be entitled to any interest with respect to such funds. In the event that we become insolvent funds that you have loaded which have arrived with and been deposited by us are protected against the claims made by our creditors.\n\n\n4.3.  Withdrawals and Redemptions\n\nYou may redeem all or part of any fiat-denominated balance held in your Stored Value Balance at any time. With respect to a Stored Value Balance denominated in Digital Tokens, only Digital Tokens acquired from the sale of a Digital Good may be redeemed for fiat to fund your fiat-denominated Stored Value Account, otherwise “unearned” Digital Tokens may not be redeemed for fiat.\n\nFunds will be transferred to your bank account or payment service provider which you have identified to us and which we support. Prior to permitting you to redeem funds, Tilia may require you to demonstrate that the name associated with your Tilia Account matches the name associated with your bank account or account with another payment service provider. For Digital Tokens, funds will be transferred to your Stored Value Balance denominated in fiat. Prior to loading your Stored Value Balance denominated in fiat, it is your responsibility to determine if funds can be transferred to the relevant payment service provider as certain payment service providers (e.g., PayPal) do not offer services in every jurisdiction.\n\nWe will charge a redemption fee (a “Redemption Fee”) upon redemption of your Stored Value Balance. This fee is set out in the Fee Schedule published on the Website (which shall include the relevant Publisher platform).\n\nWe have the right to impose limitations on your Account if we suspect that your Account is associated with illegal or suspicious activities, fraud, or otherwise poses a risk to us, the Tilia Service, a Platform or other third parties. Prior to permitting you to redeem funds from your Stored Value Balance, we may conduct checks for the purposes of preventing fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. You may be prevented or delayed from withdrawing funds in the Stored Value Balance until those checks are completed to our reasonable satisfaction in order to comply with our regulatory requirements. If we find that you have been engaged in fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing or other financial crimes, you may be temporarily or permanently unable to redeem funds from your Stored Value Balance and you may be deemed to have forfeited your interest in such funds.\n\nThe redemption request will be subject to a fee payable to Tilia, and the redemption will be processed within approximately five (5) to ten (10) business days following the request but may take up to thirty (30) days to process.\n\nIf these Terms are terminated or your Account is closed for any reason, we will redeem any funds remaining in your Stored Value Balance and transfer funds to the bank account you have registered with us.\n\nTilia has a right of set-off; therefore, if you owe Tilia fees or any other amount, we are permitted to take the amount you owe us from your Stored Value Balance.\n\nYou are responsible for paying taxes or costs that apply to payments you make or receive through your Stored Value Balance and Tilia is not responsible for collecting these from you.\n\nYou agree that Tilia may apply any funds to be credited to, or which are held in, your Stored Value Balance to any amounts you owe Tilia pursuant to these Terms. To secure your performance of these Terms, you hereby grant to Tilia a lien on any security interest in and to the funds in your Stored Value Balance in the possession of Tilia.\n\n\n4.4.  Transactions Involving the Stored Value Balance\n\nWhere a transaction is initiated from your Stored Value Balance using your security credentials, we will assume that you authorized such transaction, unless you notify us otherwise.\n\nIf you believe that a transaction using your Stored Value Balance has been carried out that you did not authorize (an \"Unauthorized Transaction\"), or if you have reason to believe that a transaction using your Stored Value Balance has been incorrectly carried out or is not complete (an \"Incorrect Transaction\"), you must contact us as soon as possible.\n\nIt is important that you regularly check your Stored Value Balance and your transaction history to ensure any Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions are identified and notified to us at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nWe are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions unless you have notified us in accordance with this Section 4.4, in which case we set out below our respective responsibilities.\n\nAs further described below, we are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions if you have acted fraudulently, intentionally, carelessly or with negligence and this has resulted in the Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions.\n\nDuring any investigation of any actual or potential Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions, we reserve the right to suspend your Stored Value Balance to avoid further losses.\n\nIf an Unauthorized Transaction occurs as a result of Tilia’s failure, we will refund you the amount of that transaction by no later than the end of the next business day after becoming aware of the Unauthorized Transaction and restore your Stored Value Balance to the state it would have been in had the Unauthorized Transaction not taken place.\n\nGenerally, you will not be liable for losses incurred after you have notified us of the Unauthorized Transaction or if we have failed at any time to provide you with the means for notifying us.\n\nWe may charge you for the first $20 of any losses you incur in respect of an Unauthorized Transaction which arises from the use of lost or stolen credentials (for example when you have failed to keep the login details secure), and if you are fraudulent, or you intentionally or negligently fail to carry out your obligations under these Terms and this results in Unauthorized Transactions (for example, if you deliberately share your email and password with a third party, or are careless or negligent in keeping your email and password secure), you may be liable for all resultant losses incurred as a result of any such Unauthorized Transactions, not just the first $20.\n\nWhere there is a dispute between us regarding whether or not a transaction is an Unauthorized Transaction, we may (but are not obliged to) temporarily credit your Stored Value Balance while we settle the dispute.\n\nWhere we determine that the transaction was authorized, we may reverse that credit and correct errors made in any statement of Stored Value Balance without prior notice to you, although please note that during this period your Stored Value Balance may be temporarily locked to avoid further Unauthorized Transactions. You will also be liable to us (as a debt) for any funds you have transferred which were temporarily credited to your Stored Value Balance.\n\nWhere an Incorrect Transaction is made because of our action or error we shall refund to you the amount of that transaction without undue delay and restore your Stored Value Balance to the state in which it would have been had the Incorrect Transaction not taken place. We will also endeavour to provide you with reasonable notice where possible. We will also pay any charges for which we are responsible. Irrespective of our liability, on your request, we shall try to trace any Incorrect Transaction initiated by you free of charge. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to trace such transactions.\n\n\n\n5.  Digital Tokens\n\n\n5.1.  Issuance\n\nThe Tilia Service may include Tilia issuing digital tokens to you, which can be used to access services and content within a Platform (“Digital Tokens”). Furthermore, Digital Tokens that are acquired from the sale by you of a Digital Good on an applicable Platform are deemed stored value in accordance with Section 4 (Stored Value Balances). If there are any inconsistencies between the two sections, then Section 4 controls.\n\nThe manner in which you obtain access or use the Digital Tokens will depend on the Publisher and will be disclosed to you by the Publisher in the terms and conditions between you and the Publisher or on the Website.\n\n\n5.2.  Acquiring Digital Tokens\n\nWhere Tilia issues Digital Tokens in connection with your use of a Publisher’s Platform, you may acquire Digital Tokens in the following ways:\n\na)  From another Platform user from the sale of a Digital Good that the you create and sell within the Platform; and/or\nb)  From purchasing them from Tilia within the Publisher’s Platform.\n\n\n5.3.  Using Digital Tokens\n\nThe use of each Digital Token is limited to the Platform in connection with which it is issued, meaning that it may not be used or transferred to any other Publisher, or through any other Platform, with which the Tilia Service is integrated.\n\nDigital Tokens may not be sublicensed, encumbered, conveyed or made subject to any right of survivorship or other disposition or use by operation of law or otherwise and you agree that any attempted disposition or use of such Digital Tokens in violation of these Terms is null and void.\n\n\n5.4.  Termination of Access to Digital Tokens\n\nWe may revoke or terminate your access to Digital Tokens that have not been earned by you through the sale of a Digital Good in the event that:\n\na)  the Digital Token program is suspended or terminated by the relevant Publisher;\nb)  we reasonably suspect or know that fraud or other illegal conduct is associated with your Account or your use of your Account or any aspects of the Tilia Service;\nc)  you have breached the relevant Publisher’s terms of service;\nd)  the Publisher of the relevant Platform directs us to terminate your access to Digital Tokens; and/or\ne)  these Terms are terminated.\n\n\n\n6.  Intellectual Property & Licenses\n\n\n6.1.  Our Content\n\nThe Tilia Service, and all of the content and technology used to provide it to you, including, without exclusion, our Website, Tilia, all logos related to the Tilia Service, patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and any other intellectual or other proprietary rights recognised in any jurisdiction (”Content”) are owned or controlled by Tilia, our affiliates, licensors, or certain other third parties.

If we refuse to complete a transaction and/or suspend, restrict or close your Account, and/or terminate your use of Tilia Services, we will (unless it would be unlawful for us to do so) provide you with notice of our actions and the reasons for refusal, suspension or closure, and where appropriate, with the procedure for correcting any factual errors that led to the refusal, suspension or closure.\n\nIn the event that we refuse to complete a transaction and/or suspend your Account or Stored Value Balance we will lift the suspension or complete the transaction as soon as reasonably practicable once the reasons for refusal and / or suspension no longer exist.

Termination for Convenience\n\nWe may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the Tilia Service and/or deactivate or cancel your Account and/or Stored Value Balance, without reason by giving you two months’ notice.

Termination – General\n\nYou acknowledge that our decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to, suspending, or closing your Account and/or Stored Value Balance, may be based on confidential criteria that are essential for the purposes of our risk management and security protocols. You agree that we are under no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management and security procedures to you.\n\nYou are not permitted to use the Tilia Services or your Account for any other purposes during these periods and we may, at our discretion, limit the functionality of the Website for you accordingly.\n\nIf we suspend or close your Account or terminate your use of Tilia Services for any reason, we reserve the right to require you to re-complete the procedures outlined at Section 2.4 (Identity Verification) before permitting you to transfer funds.\n\n\n8.6.  Closing Your Account\n\nYou may close your Account at any time by following the instructions in your Account profile or terminating your account associated with the relevant Platform, unless prohibited by applicable law. Upon terminating your Account, we will cancel any transactions that you have pending, you will no longer be able to access the Tilia Service, and we will have no further obligation or liability to you under these Terms. Unless Tilia elects to process redemptions of the Stored Value Balance, you shall not be entitled to any compensation or other payment, remedy, recourse or refund upon terminating your Account. If you have funds associated with a Stored Value Balance, we will process redemptions at our discretion in accordance with Section 4.3.\n\nYou may not close your Account to evade an investigation. If you attempt to close your Account while we are conducting an investigation, we may hold any unused funds associated with your Stored Value Balance for up to 180 days to protect Tilia, its affiliates, a Publisher, or any other third party against the risk of any reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties, and other liability.

Fees\n\n\nYou agree to pay the applicable fees listed on our Fee Schedule published on the Website (which shall include the relevant Publisher platform) (”Fees”) for use of the Tilia Service.\n\nBanks and other payment service providers may charge a transaction and/or foreign exchange fee on your transactions.

Release of Liability\n\nTilia does not control and is not responsible for anything other than the Tilia Services.  If you have a dispute regarding anything other than the Tilia Services provided to you by Tilia, including, but not limited to, any disputes with other users of the Tilia Service or Platform Publishers or regarding content on Platforms created or posted by other Platform users, neither we nor, our affiliates, and each of our, or their, respective officers, directors, agents, employees and representatives, will be liable for any claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential, direct or indirect) of any kind or nature arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\n\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\" If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.\n\n\n11.2. Tilia Service Provided on an “As is” Basis\n\nTILIA PROVIDES THE TILIA SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SOFTWARE, PROGRAMS, DOCUMENTATION, TOOLS, INTERNET-BASED SERVICES, COMPONENTS, THE WEBSITE, TILIA’S SERVERS, ANY UPDATES TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING, AND YOUR ACCOUNT, STRICTLY ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WRITTEN OR ORAL, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nNO VALUE, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS GUARANTEED OR WARRANTED WITH RESPECT TO ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING DIGITAL TOKENS OR STORED VALUE BALANCES.\n\nTilia does not ensure continuous, error-free, secure or virus-free operation of the Tilia Service or any component thereof, the Website, Tilia's servers (the \"Servers\"), or your Account, and you understand that you shall not be entitled to refunds or other compensation based on Tilia's failure to provide any of the foregoing other than as explicitly provided in these Terms.\n\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties and, to that extent, the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.\n\n\n11.3. Tilia Service Interruptions and Data Loss\n\nTilia may on occasion need to interrupt the Tilia Service with or without prior notice.  Tilia will, where possible, endeavour to provide prior notice. You agree that Tilia will not be liable for any interruption of the Tilia Service, and you understand that except as may otherwise be specifically provided in these Terms, you will not be entitled to any refunds of fees or other compensation for interruption of the Tilia Service. Likewise, in the event of data loss, we will not be liable for any purported damage or harm arising therefrom. Tilia owns the bits and bytes of electronic data stored on Tilia’s servers (the “Servers”), and accordingly will not be liable for any deletion, corruption or data loss that occurs in connection with the Tilia Service. Tilia will solely determine any disposition of the electronic data stored on the Servers and will have no obligation to reproduce, process, transfer, extract or recreate any data from the Servers, except in accordance with applicable law.\n\nThe Tilia Service is subject to scheduled and unscheduled service interruptions and loss of server data, which you do not own and for which you will not hold us liable.\n\n\n11.4. Limited Liability\n\nTilia’s total aggregate liability to you for any individual claim or series of connected claims for losses, costs, liabilities or expenses which you may suffer arising out of, or in connection with, any breach by Tilia of these Terms shall be limited to a maximum aggregate value of the funds held in your Stored Value Balance at the time of the relevant claim. Where we are considering a specific claim relating to a specific transaction this sum shall be further limited to the purchase / sale amount (as relevant) of the transaction in dispute.\n\nIn addition to the liability cap in this Section 11.4, in no event shall we, our affiliates or service Publishers, or any of our or their respective officers, directors, agents, employees or representatives, be liable for any of the following types of loss or damage arising under or in connection with these Terms or otherwise:\n\na)  consequential, indirect or special losses or damages;\nb)  loss of profits, loss of business or loss of business opportunity;\nc)  loss as a result of any failed payment due to insufficient funds in your Account;\nd)  losses incurred as a result of abnormal or unforeseeable circumstances outside our reasonable control, including delays or failures caused by problems of another system or network, mechanical breakdown, industrial action or a pandemic;\ne)  losses incurred where a law, or guidance or instruction from an governmental authority, requires us to take action, for example to terminate these Terms and close your Account; or\nf)   any other loss or damage to the extent that such loss or damage is caused or contributed to by you, or is a result of the failure by you to comply with these Terms.\n\nThe limitation of liability in this Section 11.4 is subject to any obligations that we have under applicable law and regulation, including our obligation to exercise reasonable care and skill in our provision of the Tilia Service. Nothing in these Terms shall limit our liability resulting from our fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or for death or personal injury resulting from either our or our subcontractors’ negligence.\n\n\n11.5. Indemnity\n\nYou agree to indemnify us, our affiliates and service providers, and each of our, or their, respective officers, directors, agents, employees and representatives, in respect of any costs (including attorneys' fees and any fines, fees or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) that have been reasonably incurred in connection with any claims, demands or damages arising out of or related to your breach and / or our enforcement of these Terms or your violation of any law, rule or regulation, or the rights of any third party.\n\n\n\n12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration\n\n\n12.1. Notifications of Dispute\n\nOur goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. If any controversy, allegation or claim arises out of or relates to the Tilia Service, the Website(s), the Content, these Terms, your decision to enter into these Terms, or any Additional Terms (collectively, “Dispute”), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. However, if no such information exists or if such information is not current or correct, then we have no obligation under this section. Your notice to us must be sent to: Tilia Inc., 548 Market St. PMB 59201, San Francisco, California 94104-5401 US, Attention: General Counsel. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Tilia and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, though neither party is required to resolve such dispute on terms which each party, in its sole discretion, is uncomfortable. Arbitration Procedure\n\nIF WE CANNOT RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS OF RECEIPT OF SUCH NOTICE, THEN EITHER YOU OR WE MAY ELECT TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO FORMAL ARBITRATION AS HEREINAFTER DESCRIBED. WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.\n\nFurther, you and Tilia agree that, should resolution of the Dispute(s) occur in arbitration, such Dispute(s) will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to this arbitration provision holds that this restriction, limiting the arbitration to Dispute(s) between you and Tilia, is unenforceable, then our agreement above to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 13.5 (Law and Venue).\n\nShould either you or Tilia elect to resolve the Dispute by way of binding arbitration, the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), except that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action. If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $10,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than ten (10) years' experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $10,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three (3) member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will chair the panel) selected by the two (2) party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.\n\nIf a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a \"demand for arbitration,\" then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (\"JAMS\") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of Tilia consent to in writing, except, as noted above, that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action. The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $10,000,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or other arbitration service.\n\nYou can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:\nAAA: 1.800.778.7879 or www.adr.org\nJAMS: 1.800.352.5267 or www.jamsadr.com\n\nAll parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, an arbitration hearing will be conducted, at your election, either by telephone (or other mutually agreeable remote technology) or in the City and County of San Francisco, California. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, the arbitration will be conducted in the City and County of San Francisco, California. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules (including any rules regarding hardship); but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Tilia to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this arbitration provision to be enforceable, or if the arbitrator(s) determine that you would experience an extreme hardship by paying your share of arbitration fees and costs prior to resolution of the Dispute, then Tilia will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator's decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys' fees) consistent with applicable law.\n\n\n\n13. General Provisions\n\n\n13.1. Amendments\n\nWe may change these Terms at any time in our sole discretion to the extent permitted by law. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Website and/or provide you notice of the modification by email or conspicuous notification, such as a popup, on the Platform and, in the event any such modifications decrease your rights or increase your obligations, will do so prior to such modification taking effect.\n\nWhen we change these Terms, the then-current version of these Terms supersedes all prior versions and governs your access to and use of the Tilia Service. If you continue to maintain your Account or use any portion of the Tilia Service following any change, you are deemed to have accepted and agreed to any changes, as of the effective date of any such change. If you do not wish to be bound to the changes, you must close your Account (see Section 8.6 for details) and cease using the Tilia Service.\n\nIf any part of these Terms are inconsistent with any legal requirements then we will not rely on that part but treat it as if it did actually reflect the relevant legal requirement. If we need to make operational changes before we can fully comply with the new regulatory requirement, we will make those changes as soon as reasonably practical.\n\nYou can obtain a copy of the current Terms by e-mailing a request to us at tilia-support@tilia.io.\n\n\n13.2. Entire Understanding and Agreement\n\nAny headings or descriptive summary sentences contained in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of these Terms. Additionally, the terms “include” and “including” are not limiting. As used in these Terms, references to a determination made in Tilia’s discretion means that the determination will be made by Tilia in accordance with its good faith business judgment. If any provision of these Terms shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then in such jurisdiction that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.\n\nThese Terms (including documents incorporated by reference herein) comprise the entire understanding and agreement between you and us as to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of these Terms), and every nature between and among you and Tilia.\n\n\n13.3. Assignment\n\nYou may not transfer or assign any rights or obligations you have under these Terms without our prior written consent. You may not transfer or sublicense any licenses granted by Tilia in these Terms without our prior written consent.\n\nWe may transfer or assign our rights licences, interests and/or our obligations at any time, including as part of a merger, acquisition or other corporate reorganisation involving Tilia, provided that this transfer or assignment does not materially impact the quality of the Tilia Service you receive. Subject to the foregoing, the Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.\n\nIn the event that Tilia is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you and our relationship with you (including these Terms) as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.\n\n\n13.4. Inconsistency\n\nIn the event of a conflict or inconsistency of a provision in these Terms and a provision in any other document or agreement, the provision that is most favourable to Tilia shall govern and control.\n\nIf any provision of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable law, this will not affect the validity of any other provision. If any provision is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining provisions will be enforced.\n\nWe may not always strictly enforce our rights under these Terms. If we do choose not to enforce our rights at any time, this is a temporary measure and we may enforce our rights strictly again at any time.\n\n\n13.5. Law and Venue\n\nThese Terms and the relationship between us shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. Further, you and Tilia agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California, except as provided in Section 12 regarding arbitration.\n\nThese Terms and any information or notifications that you or we are to provide should be in English. Any translation of these Terms or other documents is provided for your convenience only and may not accurately represent the information in the original English. In the event of any inconsistency, the English language version of these Terms or other documents shall prevail.\n\nAll provisions of these Terms which by their nature extend beyond the expiration or termination of these Terms, including, without limitation, the Sections relating to suspension or termination, the Account cancellation, debts owed to Tilia, general use of the Website, disputes with Tilia, and general provisions will continue to be binding and operate after the termination or expiration of these Terms.\n\n\n13.6. No Equitable or Injunctive Relief\n\nIF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE TILIA SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES AND DAMAGES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, CONTENT, PRODUCT, TILIA SERVICE, PLATFORM, PROVIDER OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, OR CONTROLLED BY TILIA OR A LICENSOR OF TILIA.\n\n\n13.7. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs\n\nAll claims you bring against Tilia must be resolved in accordance with Section 12, Dispute Resolution and Arbitration, except as expressly provided therein. All claims filed or brought contrary to the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of these Terms of Service. Should either party file a claim contrary to the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section, the other party may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to one thousand USD ($1,000.00 USD), provided that such party seeking such fees has notified the other in writing of the improperly filed claim, and the other has failed to promptly withdraw the claim.\n"
